# tools-efl-coach üß∞
Prototype for **Tools.EFL.Coach** ("TEFLC"), a concept for a subdomain of my site [EFL.Coach](https://efl.coach/). This project intends to provide English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers with a platform to teach vocabulary lists with dynamically-generated activities and materials.

# User Features üìö
- **Interactive web-apps for teaching vocabulary**
  - "No Prep Apps" accessible without login _(pictured above)_
  - "Vocabulary Apps" use connected user word lists (requires login) _(pictured above)_
  - "Print Apps" allow generating printable assets for lessons
- Customizable user account profile pictures _(pictured above)_
- Custom editable word lists _(pictured above)_


# Featured Web-Apps üíª
- **[Poggle](https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/tools-efl-coach/blob/main/TEFLC/static/screenshots/6_poggle.jpg)**: Boggle clone that generates boards with a pausable timer _(pictured below)_
- **[Visual Story Generator](https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/tools-efl-coach/blob/main/TEFLC/static/screenshots/6_visual_story_generator.jpg)**: generates story prompts via [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/)
- **[Unscramble](https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/tools-efl-coach/blob/main/TEFLC/static/screenshots/7_unscramble.jpg)**: mini-game that scrambles active word list and records high scores _(pictured below)_
- **[Word Lotto](https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/tools-efl-coach/blob/main/TEFLC/static/screenshots/7_word_lotto.jpg)**: a simple EFL game for young learners to practice reading and writing vocabulary _(pictured below)_
- **[Word Search Generator](https://github.com/chris-p-schneider/tools-efl-coach/blob/main/TEFLC/static/screenshots/8_wordsearch_generator.jpg)**: unlike other word searches, this one generates filler characters based on the [relative letter frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) in the English language

# Final Notes üìù
This project was guided by Corey Schaefer's [Flask Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) series. This was my big pandemic lockdown project and was all self-taught through YouTube, documentation, and experimentation. I learned a lot about using Python for web development and templatizing code. 

I have left most of my files unedited to include my detailed comments, concerns, and to-dos. Though I consider this project unfinished and this version limited, everything included above is functional. I hope to rebuild this project later into my current studies as a Software Development student.
