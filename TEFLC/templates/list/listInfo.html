		List Info</h1>
	<p class="status-para font20">
		I've designed the text input process to make it easy to copy/paste from websites or word documents with little tedious manual clean-up.
		When you input text into a new list, a few things happen:
		</p>
	<ol>
<!-- STEPS -->
	<li class="status-para font20">
		First, your list gets checked as to whether it uses commas, tabs, or line breaks to separate words. 
		Please use one of these:
		<ul>
			<li class="top10 bottom5">[<code>,</code>] <span>Comma</span>: vocabulary, words, like this</li>
			<li class="bottom5">[<code>	</code>] <span>Tab</span>:  words	separated	by tabs (not spaces)
			<li class="bottom10">[<code>\n</code>] <span>New line</span>: 
					<ul><li>Words</li>
						<li>separated</li>
						<li>this way</li>
					</ul>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li class="status-para font20">
		Next, lone single characters [like '<code>a</code>'] are removed from your text. 
		Some still might get through, so it's necessary to double-check afterwards by clicking "Edit".
		</li>
	<li class="status-para font20">
		Then, non-English characters, numbers, and symbols are removed.
		There are a few exceptions, <span style="border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(0,0%, 67%);">including a normal space</span>:
		<br><ul>
			<li class="top10 bottom5">[<code>'</code>] <span>Apostrophe</span>: doctor's</li>					
			<li class="bottom5">[<code>!</code>] <span>Exclamation</span>: Wow!</li>					
			<li class="bottom5">[<code>?</code>] <span>Question</span>: Really?</li>					
			<li class="bottom5">[<code>.</code>] <span>Period</span>: Mt. Everest</li>
			<li class="bottom10">[<code>-</code>] <span>Hyphen</span>: twenty-one</li>
			</ul>
		I decided on these characters because I think they are most likely to be used within vocabulary.
		Please note that all words are CaSe Sensitive. Capitalization matters.
		</li>
	<li class="status-para font20">
		Next, the text is filtered again for single characters that might have been created when the non-letters were removed.
		</li>
	<li class="status-para font20">
		Additionally, lowercase <code>i'</code> is reformatted to capital <code>I'</code>.
		</li>
	<li class="status-para font20">
		Lastly, your list is saved with the above changes.
		I use line breaks as my delimiter, so your final list will be reformatted as such. 
		When you edit your list, it will not be reformatted again.
		</li>

		<code>INPUT</code> to make a point.<br>
		<textarea style="width: 90%; height: 15vh;">Wow! Hopefully this example helps?
I'm going to make another list form that can process text from articles in paragraph format.
That said, this list input form isn't really meant for that. 
If you're a coworker of mine, you can copy/paste the vocab lists from Google Drive easily.
Eventually, I'll save a bank of ready-to-use JS vocab lists, though I mostly teach JS5 - JS8.
I don't think this site is best for grammar words, but we'll get into that later.
Happy teaching!
